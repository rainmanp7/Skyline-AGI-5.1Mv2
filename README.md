Skyline-AGI-5.1Mv2 is an advanced framework designed to explore and implement concepts for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This project focuses on adaptive learning and memory retention to simulate human-like intelligence. By incorporating features like **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)** and **Experience Replay**, Skyline-AGI-5.1Mv2 is structured to retain knowledge over time while continuously learning new information.

## Purpose and Functionality

The primary goal of Skyline-AGI-5.1Mv2 is to simulate AGI capabilities by enabling:
- **Memory Retention**: The `AssimilationMemoryModule` uses reverse reinforcement learning to help the system remember past experiences and refine its decision-making.
- **Dynamic Model Optimization**: A parallel Bayesian optimization process adapts model parameters based on data complexity, enhancing learning efficiency.
- **Knowledge Base Management**: The `TieredKnowledgeBase` organizes and retrieves knowledge to support experience retention and model updates.
